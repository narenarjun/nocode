The no code project is a inspiration after [Kelsey hightowers' NoCode repo.](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode).

Changes i have made are added a dockerfile with apline as base image since scratch images aren't built by docker and when tried to execute , we get error. 

When the build image is ran, we get a list of all the files, so simple.
